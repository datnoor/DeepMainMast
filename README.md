# DeepMainMast

This repository contains the code implementation of "paper name and link". There are two folders i) dmmsinglechain supportd single chain protein maps ii) dmmmultichain supports multi chain protein maps.

## Dependencies

Use the requirements.txt file and install packages using pip as follows. There are same requirements for both single chain and multi-chain.

```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Then install BioTEMPy package using pip. Installing it separately is crucial because it has dependecy conflicts with bio package. Hence after installing all packages
using requirements.txt, we then separately install BioTEMPy using pip as follows

```
pip install BioTEMPy
```

## How to run

First choose which pipeline you want to execute, Single chain or Multi-chain. Follow the details for each pipeline. And then read the readme files inside the respective folders for next steps.
